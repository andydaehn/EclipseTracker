# EclipseTracker
Eclipse Tracker will provide a platform in which to watch a solar eclipse from anywhere in the world. There will be a live feed available from NASA, or other sources, in which the eclipse can be watched (for demonstration purposes, outside of event time frame, a live feed from another source will be provided). Included will be information regarding location, weather, and other equipment. A map will be provided to show the user the most recent updates on the eclipse track. GPS will be able to confirm the most advantageous viewing times, as well as current weather with cloud cover. If a person happens to be in the path of an eclipse there will be information on how to take pictures with a smartphone, and share the results via social media. Information will be provided on what type of glasses that are needed to view, and where to buy them.
